# Zero-day-Sacam-
Zero-day scams pose a significant cybersecurity challenge as they exploit previously unseen attack patterns that evade traditional rule-based detection systems. This project presents a multimodal, unsupervised anomaly detection framework for identifying zero-day online scams using image, URL, and textual data. Independent feature extraction is performed for each modality, where autoencoders analyze website screenshots, URLs, and communication text to detect anomalous behavior based on reconstruction error. The individual risk scores are normalized and combined using a weighted multimodal risk fusion engine to generate a final verdict with an interpretable risk score. A Gradio-based web interface enables real-time user interaction and transparent explanations. By eliminating dependency on labeled datasets, the proposed system effectively detects previously unknown scam patterns, making it suitable for real-world zero-day threat detection.
